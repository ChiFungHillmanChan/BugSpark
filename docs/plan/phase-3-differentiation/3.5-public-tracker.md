# 3.5 Public Bug Tracker / Status Page

## Priority: LOW | Complexity: MEDIUM

Tools like Featurebase and Canny offer public bug trackers where end users can see the status of their reported bugs. This builds transparency and reduces duplicate reports.

---

## Feature Scope

### MVP
- Public page for each project: `bugspark.dev/p/{project-slug}`
- Lists reported bugs with status (no sensitive data)
- Users can check if their bug is already reported
- Search and filter by status/severity
- Optional: upvote existing bugs

### Future
- Feature request board
- Changelog / release notes
- Email notifications to reporters when status changes

## Architecture

### Public Report View

Only show limited data publicly:

```python
class PublicReportResponse(CamelModel):
    id: str
    title: str
    status: str
    severity: str
    category: str
    created_at: datetime
    upvote_count: int
    # Explicitly EXCLUDE: description details, console logs, network logs,
    # screenshots, reporter email, internal comments
```

### API Endpoints

```
GET /public/projects/{slug}           -- Public project info
GET /public/projects/{slug}/reports   -- Public report list (paginated)
GET /public/projects/{slug}/reports/{id} -- Public report detail
POST /public/projects/{slug}/reports/{id}/upvote -- Upvote a report
```

### Project Settings

Add to project model:

```python
public_tracker_enabled = Column(Boolean, default=False)
public_tracker_slug = Column(String(100), unique=True, nullable=True)
```

### Dashboard Public Tracker Settings

In project settings, add a "Public Tracker" tab:
- Enable/disable toggle
- Custom slug
- Choose which fields are visible publicly
- Customize page branding

### Public Page (Next.js)

Create a new route group in the dashboard:

```
packages/dashboard/src/app/(public)/p/[slug]/
  page.tsx       -- Public bug list
  [id]/page.tsx  -- Public bug detail
  layout.tsx     -- Public page layout (no auth required)
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `public_tracker_enabled` and `public_tracker_slug` to Project model
2. Create Alembic migration
3. Create public API endpoints (no auth required)
4. Create `PublicReportResponse` schema (limited fields)
5. Create public tracker pages in dashboard
6. Add upvote model and endpoint
7. Add public tracker settings to project settings page
8. Add plan gating

## Plan Gating

| Plan | Public Tracker |
|------|---------------|
| Free | None |
| Starter | None |
| Pro | Basic (read-only) |
| Team | Full (with upvotes) |
| Enterprise | Custom domain |
