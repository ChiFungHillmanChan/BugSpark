# 4.4 White-Label / Reseller Mode

## Priority: LOW | Complexity: MEDIUM

Agencies want to offer bug reporting to their clients under their own brand. Marker.io's Agency plan ($129+/mo) offers this. White-labeling creates a B2B2C revenue stream.

---

## Feature Scope

- Complete removal of BugSpark branding (widget, dashboard, emails)
- Custom domain for dashboard (e.g., `bugs.agency.com`)
- Custom logo, colors, and company name throughout
- Agencies manage multiple client projects under one account
- Client portal with agency branding

## Architecture

### White-Label Configuration

```python
class WhiteLabelConfig(Base):
    __tablename__ = "white_label_configs"

    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    organization_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("organizations.id"), unique=True)
    company_name = Column(String(200))
    logo_url = Column(String(500))
    favicon_url = Column(String(500))
    primary_color = Column(String(7))
    custom_domain = Column(String(200), unique=True, nullable=True)
    email_from_name = Column(String(200))
    email_from_address = Column(String(200), nullable=True)
    hide_powered_by = Column(Boolean, default=True)
```

### Custom Domain

- Use Cloudflare for SaaS or Vercel custom domains
- Customer adds CNAME record pointing to BugSpark
- SSL auto-provisioned

### Widget Branding

Already partially supported via `branding` config:
- Extend to fully remove "Powered by BugSpark"
- Replace with agency logo/name

### Dashboard Theming

- Load white-label config on dashboard init
- Override logo, colors, and company name
- Replace "BugSpark" text with custom company name

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `WhiteLabelConfig` model and migration
2. Create admin API for white-label configuration
3. Implement custom domain routing (Vercel/Cloudflare)
4. Update widget to fully support white-labeling
5. Update dashboard to load and apply white-label config
6. Update email templates to use white-label branding
7. Create agency dashboard for managing client projects

## Plan Gating

Enterprise plan only. May also offer as add-on for Team plan.
