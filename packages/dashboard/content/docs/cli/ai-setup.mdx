# AI Setup

Use this page as a ready-to-paste prompt for your favourite AI coding assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). It tells the AI exactly what BugSpark is, how to analyse your project, and how to install the widget — all in one go.

Copy the prompt that matches your language, paste it into your AI chat, and let the assistant do the heavy lifting.

## Tips

- **New or existing user?** — The prompt includes a decision tree that asks the AI to check whether you already have a BugSpark account or need to register first. This ensures the AI runs the right CLI commands for your situation.
- **Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`** — The prompt reminds the AI, but make sure you have your real key from the [Dashboard](/settings/tokens) or from `bugspark init`.
- **Works with any AI** — Cursor, GitHub Copilot Chat, Claude, ChatGPT, Windsurf, or any code-aware assistant.
- **Customise freely** — You can add extra instructions (e.g. "also configure dark mode" or "put the button on the left side") after pasting the prompt.
