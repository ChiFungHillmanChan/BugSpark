# CLI Installation

The BugSpark CLI lets you manage projects and bug reports directly from your terminal — no browser needed.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your machine
- A **BugSpark account** (sign up at the [Dashboard](/register))

## Install

Install the CLI globally using npm, pnpm, or yarn:

```bash
npm install -g @bugspark/cli
```

```bash
pnpm add -g @bugspark/cli
```

```bash
yarn global add @bugspark/cli
```

After installing, verify it works:

```bash
bugspark --version
```

You should see `0.1.0` (or the latest version).

## First-Time Setup

Run these two commands to get started:

```bash
# Step 1 — Log in (opens browser to create a token)
bugspark login

# Step 2 — Set up your project (interactive)
bugspark init
```

That's it! Read on for a detailed walkthrough of each step.

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

Before the CLI can talk to BugSpark, you need a **Personal Access Token** (PAT).

1. Go to **[Dashboard → Settings → Personal Access Tokens](/settings/tokens)**
2. Click **"Create Token"**
3. Give it a name (e.g. `My Laptop CLI`)
4. Choose an expiry (or "Never")
5. Click **Create**
6. **Copy the token immediately** — it starts with `bsk_pat_` and will only be shown once

<Callout type="warning" title="Save your token!">
  The full token is only displayed once when you create it. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Log In

Run the login command:

```bash
bugspark login
```

The CLI will:

1. Ask for your **API URL** (press Enter to use the default `https://bugspark-api.onrender.com/api/v1`)
2. Try to open your browser to the token creation page
3. Ask you to **paste your token** (`bsk_pat_...`)
4. **Verify** the token by calling the API
5. **Save** your credentials to `~/.bugspark/config.json`

Once you see ✓ **Logged in as Your Name**, you're ready to go.

<Callout type="tip" title="Config file">
  Your token is stored at `~/.bugspark/config.json` with restrictive file permissions (600). Only your user account can read it.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Initialize a Project

```bash
bugspark init
```

This interactive command will:

- Show your existing projects (if any)
- Let you **select** an existing project or **create a new one**
- Display the **widget installation snippet** with your API key pre-filled

Example output:

```
  🐛⚡ BugSpark Project Setup

? Select a project or create a new one
  ❯ My Web App (bsk_pub_abc...)
    Another Project (bsk_pub_def...)
    + Create new project
```

After selecting or creating a project, you'll see ready-to-paste installation code for both script tag and npm.
