# Bug Management

The Bugs page provides two views for managing reports: **Table** and **Kanban**.

## Table View

The default table view lists all bug reports with sortable columns:

- **ID** — unique tracking ID (e.g. `BSK-42`)
- **Title** — bug summary
- **Severity** — `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- **Status** — current workflow status
- **Created** — relative timestamp

Click any row to open the full bug detail page.

## Kanban View

Switch to Kanban mode for a visual workflow board. Reports are organized into columns by status:

- **New** — freshly submitted, unreviewed
- **Triaging** — under investigation
- **In Progress** — actively being fixed
- **Resolved** — fix deployed
- **Closed** — verified and archived

## Filtering

Use the filter bar to narrow results:

- **Search** — text search across title and description
- **Status chips** — toggle one or more status filters
- **Severity chips** — toggle one or more severity filters
- **Date range** — last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or all time
- **Clear** — reset all filters

## Bug Detail Page

Clicking a report opens the detail page with:

- **Metadata panel** — severity, status, assignee, reporter, timestamps, device info
- **Screenshot viewer** — toggle between original and annotated screenshots
- **Console logs** — expandable list of captured console entries
- **Network waterfall** — timeline of HTTP requests with timing data
- **Session timeline** — chronological list of user actions
- **Comment thread** — team discussion and notes

## Updating Status

Change a report's status using the dropdown in the metadata panel. Available transitions:

| From | To |
|------|----|
| new | triaging, in_progress, resolved, closed |
| triaging | in_progress, resolved, closed |
| in_progress | resolved, closed |
| resolved | closed, in_progress (reopen) |
| closed | in_progress (reopen) |

## Assigning Reports

Select a team member from the assignee dropdown to assign a report. The assignee receives a notification and the report appears in their filtered view.
