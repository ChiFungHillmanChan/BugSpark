# Dashboard Overview

The BugSpark dashboard is your central hub for monitoring and managing bug reports.

## Home Screen

The main dashboard shows four key metrics at a glance:

- **Total Bugs** — lifetime count of all bug reports across your projects
- **Open Bugs** — reports with status `new`, `triaging`, or `in_progress`
- **Resolved Today** — reports marked as `resolved` in the last 24 hours
- **Avg Resolution** — average time from report creation to resolution

Below the metrics, two charts provide visual insights:

- **Bug Trend** — line chart showing report volume over time
- **Severity Breakdown** — distribution of `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `low` reports

## Recent Bugs

The bottom section lists the 5 most recent bug reports with columns for tracking ID, title, severity, status, and creation date. Click any row to view the full report.

## Navigation

The sidebar provides quick access to all sections:


| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dashboard** | Overview metrics and charts |
| **Bugs** | Full bug list with table and kanban views |
| **Projects** | Manage projects and API keys |
| **Settings** | Profile, appearance, and language |

## Project Switcher

If you have multiple projects, use the dropdown in the sidebar to switch between them. Reports and metrics will filter to the selected project.
