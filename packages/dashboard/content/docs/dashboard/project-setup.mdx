# Project Setup

Projects are the top-level containers for bug reports in BugSpark. Each project has its own API key and configuration.

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Enter a **Project Name** (e.g. "My Web App")
4. Enter the **Domain** where your app runs (e.g. `myapp.com`)
5. Click **Create**

The project is created with a unique API key in the format `bsk_pub_...`.

## API Key Management

Each project has one active API key. Use it in the widget or API requests:

```bash
X-API-Key: bsk_pub_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

### Viewing Your API Key

Go to **Projects**, click on a project, and the API key is displayed in the project detail page. Click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

### Rotating Keys

If an API key is compromised, rotate it immediately:

1. Open the project detail page
2. Click **Rotate API Key**
3. Confirm the action
4. Update the key in your widget configuration

The old key is invalidated immediately.

## Project Settings

Project settings are stored as a JSON object. Current settings include:

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `webhookUrl` | `string` | URL for webhook notifications |
| `notifyOnCritical` | `boolean` | Send alerts for critical bugs |

Update settings via the API:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.bugspark.dev/api/v1/projects/:id \
  -H "Cookie: bugspark_access_token=..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"settings": {"webhookUrl": "https://..."}}'
```

## Deleting a Project

Deleting a project is a soft delete — the project is deactivated but its reports are preserved. You can delete a project from the project detail page.
