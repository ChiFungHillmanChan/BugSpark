# Getting Started

Get BugSpark running in your project in three steps.

## 1. Create a Project

Sign up at [BugSpark Dashboard](/register) and create your first project.
You will need:

- A **project name** (e.g. "My Web App")
- The **domain** where your app runs (e.g. `myapp.com`)

After creation, you will receive an **API key** that looks like `bsk_pub_...`. Keep this key handy.

## 2. Install the Widget

Add the BugSpark widget to your frontend. Choose the method that fits your stack:

### Script Tag (simplest)

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.bugspark.dev/widget.js"
  data-project="YOUR_API_KEY"
  data-position="bottom-right"
  async
></script>
```

### NPM Package

```bash
npm install @bugspark/widget
```

```typescript
import { BugSpark } from "@bugspark/widget";

BugSpark.init({
  projectKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  position: "bottom-right",
});
```

## 3. Start Receiving Reports

Once the widget is installed, your users can click the bug button to submit reports.
Each report automatically includes:

- **Screenshot** with optional annotations
- **Console logs** (errors, warnings, info)
- **Network requests** (failed calls, slow responses)
- **Device metadata** (browser, OS, viewport size)
- **User action timeline** (clicks, navigations, form submissions)

View all reports in the [Dashboard](/dashboard). Reports are organized by project and can be filtered by severity, status, and date range.
