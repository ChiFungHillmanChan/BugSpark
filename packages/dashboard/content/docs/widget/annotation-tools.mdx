# Annotation Tools

The widget includes built-in screenshot annotation tools so users can highlight exactly where the problem is.

## How It Works

1. User clicks the bug button to open the report form
2. Clicks the camera icon to capture a screenshot
3. The page is captured and an annotation editor opens
4. User draws, highlights, or adds arrows to mark the issue
5. The annotated screenshot is attached to the report

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Draw** | Freehand drawing in the selected color |
| **Arrow** | Point to specific UI elements |
| **Rectangle** | Highlight areas with a colored box |
| **Text** | Add text labels to the screenshot |
| **Blur** | Redact sensitive information |

## Color Options

The annotation toolbar provides several colors:

- Red (default) for highlighting errors
- Yellow for warnings or areas of concern
- Green for expected vs. actual behavior
- Blue for informational notes

## Screenshot Capture

Screenshots are captured using the browser's native `html2canvas` rendering. The capture includes:

- The visible viewport content
- Scrolled-out-of-view content (optional)
- CSS-rendered elements including shadows, gradients, and transforms

The original screenshot and annotated version are both stored. In the dashboard, you can toggle between the original and annotated views.

## Privacy Considerations

Users can use the **Blur** tool to redact sensitive data (passwords, personal info) before submitting. The blurred regions are permanently applied to the annotated screenshot before upload.

Input fields with `type="password"` are automatically masked in screenshots.
