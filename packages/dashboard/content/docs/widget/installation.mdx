# Widget Installation

The BugSpark widget is a lightweight JavaScript snippet that adds a bug reporting button to your application.

## Environment Variable

All installation methods below reference an environment variable for your project API key. **Never hard-code your API key in source code.**

Add this to your `.env` (or `.env.local`) file:

```bash
BUGSPARK_PROJECT_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can find your project API key in the [Dashboard](/dashboard) under **Project Settings**.

## Script Tag

The simplest way to add BugSpark. Paste this before the closing `</body>` tag:

<WidgetScriptSnippet />

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your project API key from the dashboard or your `.env` file.

> For server-rendered pages, inject the environment variable at build time or via your templating engine.

The widget loads asynchronously and does not block page rendering.

## NPM / React

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @bugspark/widget
```

Initialize in your app entry point:

<WidgetNpmSnippet />

For React apps, initialize inside a `useEffect`:

<WidgetReactSnippet />

## Vue

<WidgetVueSnippet />

> Vue (Vite) requires the `VITE_` prefix for client-side environment variables. Add `VITE_BUGSPARK_PROJECT_KEY` to your `.env` file.

## Angular

<WidgetAngularSnippet />

> Add `bugsparkProjectKey` to your `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` files.

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, you should see a small bug icon in the corner of your page. Click it to open the report form and submit a test report. Check the [Dashboard](/dashboard) to confirm the report arrived.
